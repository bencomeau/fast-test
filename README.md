# fast-test README

Fast Test allows you to quickly run tests on your currently active file.

## Features

- Run a single test on the currently active file.
- Watch the currently active file for changes and rerun tests related to changed files.
- Does not run Coverage since the idea is to target development speed while writing tests.

## Requirements

- node: `>=5.2` (support for npx)

## Extension Settings

Coming soon (see **Roadmap** below)

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

Initial release of Fast Test

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Roadmap

### Extension Configuration Support

Add configuration settings to allow:

- setting your test runner (ie: jest, mocha, etc)
- default terminal (integrated or external)

### External Terminal Support

Allow the extension to execute the test commands to your preferred terminal.

### Tests

Ironically, I need to add tests.

**Enjoy**
